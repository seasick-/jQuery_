//First, $.ajax returns a promise.1 Most jQuery users are used to using $.ajax by 
//passing error and success functions in the call to create the request. But you can 
//also treat the return value of $.ajax as a promise and reap the benefits of 
//operating on deferreds. Second, we’ve seen that jQuery animate methods return an 
//object with a promise method that returns you a promise. Third, when you select a 
//set of DOM elements (e.g., $('p') to select all HTML <p> elements), the result is 
//an object with a promise method that also returns a promise. By default it resolves 
//when all animations on the selected elements are finished.

The jQuery promise function can be used to obtain a promise against 
the completion of actions on a selection of DOM elements. Here’s an 
example, adapted from the .promise() documentation:


<script>
$('div').each(function(i){ $(this).fadeIn().fadeOut(1000 * (i + 1));
});
$('div').promise().done(function(){
// All <div> animations are finished.
});
</script>

By default, the promise method will return a promise from a deferred that 
is resolved when all animations on an element collection have fired. You can
also pass an argument to promise to name a different event queue that the
promise should correspond to (the default name is “fx,” for “effects”). An
even more advanced method is to pass an object to promise, in which case 
jQuery will attach the usual promise methods (done, fail, etc.) to the object 
and return it. These nondefault uses of promise are outside the scope of this 
book. To learn more, see the .promise() documentation and hunt for examples online.
